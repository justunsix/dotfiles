    # # It is sometimes useful to fine-tune packages, for example, by applying
    # # overrides. You can do that directly here, just don't forget the

    # # fonts?

    # # You can also create simple shell scripts directly inside your
    # # configuration. For example, this adds a command 'my-hello' to your

  # Manager then you have to manually source 'hm-session-vars.sh' located at

  #  ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  #
  # or
